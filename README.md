i'm an Information Technology student at **TUM Campus Heilbronn**.  
i like understanding how things work and turning ideas into small, working projects.

- 🎓 studying: IT @ TUM (heilbronn)
- 💻 interested in: backend, systems, and tools that make life easier
- 🧠 learning: clean code, performance, and software design
- 🌍 based in germany

---

### what i'm into

- **backend & tooling**  
  building scripts, small services, and utilities that solve real problems.

- **systems & low-level basics**  
  understanding how code runs under the hood (assemblers, instructions, memory).

- **clean structure**  
  keeping projects readable, simple, and easy to extend.

(i use games sometimes as learning projects, but i'm not mainly focused on game development.)

### projects

#### 🔍 WebBoost
_analyse your blog here_

- **python** project that analyses a blog / website  
- looks at structure and content, then prints simple feedback  
- focus on: clear output, practical use, and thinking from a user's perspective

---

#### 🧠 MIPS-Assembler

- **c++** project that implements parts of a MIPS assembler  
- works with instructions, registers, and basic parsing logic  
- focus on: low-level thinking, structured code, and correctness

---

#### 🎮 RuneRunner
_a MazeRunner-style project used for practice_

- project with movement, collision, and simple rules  
- mainly a way to practice state management, input handling, and debugging  
- focus on: logic and structure more than the "game" itself

---

### other repos

- **Vishnu-Mehta** – my first git repo, where i started learning git and basic workflows  
- **GamevangersPB** – another practice project, used for experimenting with logic and structure  
- **Java-project** *(private)* – java-based project, used to learn language features and structure  
- **The-Byte-and-the-Furious** *(private)* – experimental repo for trying out ideas

some repos are private while they're still messy or experimental.

---

### tools and tech

- **languages:** python, c++, java, html / css (and some basic js)  
- **concepts:** oop, basic data structures and algorithms, git, cli tools  
- **tools:** github, vs code, linux, terminals

### how i work

- i try to write code that future-me can still understand  
- i prefer simple and clear over “clever but confusing”  
- i’m comfortable reading docs and figuring things out on my own  
- i like feedback and i treat projects as a way to improve step by step
